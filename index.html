  <h2>The World Wide Web</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title = "html5 specification">The World Wide WEb(WWW)</a> is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet. If you don't wish to read all the stuffs below just refer to <a href= "https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%9D%B8%ED%84%B0%EB%84%B7" target="_blank" title = "the Internet">NamuWiki.</a></p>
  <p>The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades and upon whose technologies the Web is built.</p>
  <p>English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.The browser was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the general public in August 1991. The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age, and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.</p>
  <p>Web resources may be any type of downloaded media, but web pages are hypertext documents formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).Special HTML syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs which permits users to navigate to other web resources. In addition to text, web pages may contain references to images, video, audio, and software components which are either displayed or internally executed in the user's web browser to render pages or streams of multimedia content.</p>
  <p>Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name, make up a website. Websites are stored in computers that are running a web server, which is a program that responds to requests made over the Internet from web browsers running on a user's computer. Website content can be provided by a publisher, or interactively from user-generated content. Websites are provided for a myriad of informative, entertainment, commercial, and governmental reasons.</p>
  <p>Historians generally agree that a turning point for the Web began with the 1993 introduction of Mosaic, a graphical web browser developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign. Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become by far the most popular protocol on the Internet.The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format. It thus played an important role in popularising use of the Internet.</p>
  <p>The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used without much distinction. However, the two terms do not mean the same thing. The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks. In contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URIs. Web resources are accessed using HTTP or HTTPS, which are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet's transport protocols.</p>
  <p>By the way - what is the 'Internet'? <br> Think of the Internet as a massive map. Every computer connected to the Internet is a location with a physical address on that map. On the Internet, this address is a series of numbers called an IP address. It's not easy to remember a list of seemingly random numbers. Fortunately, the people who created Internet protocols recognized this problem and came up with a solution: Domain names. A domain name uses words instead of numbers for Internet addresses.</p>
  <p>By the way - what is a 'Domain Name'? <br> The internet and the World Wide Web are wild frontiers that rely on computer languages and codes to find and share data and information. One of the most fundamental instruments of the internet is the Domain Name System, or DNS.DNS is a protocol within the set of standards for how computers exchange data on the internet and on many private networks, known as the TCP/IP protocol suite. Its purpose is vital, as it helps convert easy-to-understand domain names like "howstuffworks.com" into an Internet Protocol (IP) address, such as 70.42.251.42 that computers use to identify each other on the network. It is, in short, a system of matching names with numbers.</p>
  <p>By the way - how are domain names kept unique? <br> That's where registrars come in. A registrar is an authority that can assign domain names directly under one or more top-level domains and register them with InterNIC, a service of ICANN, which enforces uniqueness of domain names across the internet. Each domain registration becomes part of a central domain registration database known as the whois database. Today companies like GoDaddy.com offer domain registration in addition to many other website and domain management services.
